# SimiliarUsersByMovies
In a movie rating system by viewers, the SYSTEM search for pairs of viewers who have seen several common movies using **min hash** and the **LSH algorithm**.  We consider the two-way relationship watched (X, Y): "user X has seen the movie Y", representing it (only conceptually, you will not construct it) as a 0/1-register where the lines correspond to users and columns correspond to movies. We assume that the K viewers (users) are already numbered with consecutive identifier numbers (userId) in the range {1,2,…, Κ-1, Κ}, while the N films also have unique identifiers (movieId), the but which are not necessarily consecutive numbers in {1,2,…, N-1, N}.
